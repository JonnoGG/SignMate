#### According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 466 million people worldwide with disabling hearing loss. A large portion of this population, communicate via American Sign Language (ASL) - a series of hand gestures that represent english letters and/or words. In order for people with such disabilites to coexist within our communities, everyone interacting with them should be familiar with ASL. That is where SignMate comes in!

#### SignMate is a web app that randomly generates short ASL videos representing common english words and prompts the user to submit a text input to match the given words. If successful, the user will receive postive feedback and they can regenerate a new set of videos. If unsuccessful, they will receive a failure warning indicating the words they missed.
